## Make a suggestion

Please fill out an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/OLEGSHA/KenDB3/issues) and label it an enhancement if you believe it suits KenDB goals and it should be easy enough to implement.


## Contribute code

Great! Fork the repository on GitHub and begin. Development setup should not take more than a minute; see [README](../README.md#developer-setup).

Take a look at [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md), it has some onboarding and tips and tricks. There's decent high-level documentation in [docs](.), especially [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

When you've got some commits, open a draft pull request on GitHub. We want to review and give corrections earlier rather then later.

If you want to implement a new feature that has not been discussed in issues yet, please open an issue or get in touch some other way first.
